      "explanations": {
        "a": "Unconfined compression strength cannot be found out by conducting a direct shear test.",
        "b": "Consolidation experiment is conducted to determine the settlement of soil in a confined environment.",
        "c": "Unconfined compression strength is a type of triaxial compression test where there is no lateral confinement to the sample and thus unconfined compression test can be derived from triaxial compression test.",
        "d": "Permeability test is conducted to determine the capacity of soil to allow the water to percolate through it."

      "question": "Select the incorrect statement",
      "answers": {
        "a": "In a direct shear box test , the plane of shear failure is predetermined",
        "b": "Better control is achieved on the drainage of soil in a triaxial compression test.",
        "c": "Stress distribution on the failure plane in case of triaxial compression is uniform.",
        "d": "Unconfined compression tests can be carried out for all types of soil."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Direct shear test is used to determine the shear strength of soil. The failure does not occur at the weakest plane, it occurs at a predetermined plane where the horizontal plane is separated by two halves of the shear box.",
        "b": "The test has  control over the drainage condition of soil. The test can be conducted on all three types of drainage conditions.",
        "c": "In triaxial compression test, the specimen fails at a weak point where failure in the plane is not forced. The stress distribution is uniform.",
        "d": "Unconfined compression tests are not carried out for all types of soil. It is not applicable  for cohesion less or coarse grained soil."

      "question": "If a cohesive soil is subjected to vertical compressive load, the inclination of crack to the horizontal is",

        "b": "45°",
        "c": "63°",
        "d": "38°"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "According to the formula for the inclination for failure plane with respect to the major principal axis is α = 45 + Ø/2, for cohesive soil we know that angle of internal friction Ø is zero and therefore we get the inclination of failure plane or inclination of crack to the horizontal is 45°, hence 90° is the wrong answer.",
        "b": "According to the formula for the inclination for failure plane with respect to the major principal axis is α = 45 + Ø/2, for cohesive soil we know that angle of internal friction Ø is zero and therefore we get the inclination of failure plane or inclination of crack to the horizontal is 45°.",

        "d": "According to the formula for the inclination for failure plane with respect to the major principal axis is α = 45 + Ø/2, for cohesive soil we know that angle of internal friction Ø is zero and therefore we get the inclination of failure plane or inclination of crack to the horizontal is 45°, hence 38° is the wrong answer."

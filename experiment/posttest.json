        "b": "Consolidation experiment is conducted to determine the settlement of soil in a confined environment.",
        "c": "Unconfined compression strength is a type of triaxial compression test where there is no lateral confinement to the sample and thus unconfined compression test can be derived from triaxial compression test.",

        "d": "Permeability test is conducted to determine the capacity of soil to allow the water to percolate through it.Direct shear test is used to determine the shear strength of soil. The failure does not occur at the weakest plane, it occurs at a predetermined plane where the horizontal plane is separated by two halves of the shear box.The test has  control over the drainage condition of soil. The test can be conducted on all three types of drainage conditions."
